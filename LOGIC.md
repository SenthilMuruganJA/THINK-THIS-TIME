This project is initiated for HCL-HACKATHON.
This APP aims at Automatic Attendence Record System.
This was developed in order to need the reduce the burden of college Non-Teaching Staffs and instantaneous monitering of students by staff.
ENVIRONMENT NEEDED:
           Windows OS
           Server
           Android Mobile
           Ecllipse
           ANACONDA
SOFTWARE USED:
           python
           java
           SQL
DESCRIPTION OF THIS PROJECT:
                This project contains the main concept of image-processing and the input is taken from the web camera.The input is processed
with data set and the result is obtained.The output is marking of attendence of each student by tracking their movement 
whether student-In or student-Out.The student_In may be recorded at either starting time of period or late by certain minutes.The 
student_Out may be recorded as either ending of period or calls by staff.
                Another useful application of this project is Teachers notification.This includes the data set comparision which is 
time-table and to find which teacher should be present at that time.In case of their absence, an notification is sent to them in order to 
alert them.
                Next the main advantage of this project is to reduce the workof attender using Chat-bot.This is a Text-to speech technology,
where a staff or the H.O.D. needs to call a student by just inimating his/her roll number.
IMAGE PROCESIING:(DATASET=IMAGE)
               This is to recoganise students and staff while their ID card photos are taken.This conatains delineation of each part 
of face and recoganising them.After that thier movement is recorded such as in and out.These data are compared with RTC and recorded.
SPEECH PROCESSING:(CHAT-BOT)
               His/her roll number is used here.If the staff needs the student ,the intimation can be given to this app where binary search 
tree is performed to find the student.And these are converted as voice and sounded in the class.
ANDROID:(DATASET=TIME-TABLE via DATABASE)
               This is comparision operation where the time-table is stored.In the absence of teachers for 10 minutes,the message is sent to
the staff via app.If they are present,an attendence mark is recorded for them.

This the Upcoming project proposed by Students.
